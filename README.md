# PyBer_Analysis

## Challenge Overview:
To analyze rideshare information and create visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. The purpose was essentially to get analyze and get data for determining keys metrics that would help allow concerned parties to compare rural, suburban, and urban city rides, by organizing it in tables and charts that show totals in all city type categories. 

## Results:
The following are some of the significant observations that can be obtained from the data as sorted by city type:

There are some trends to be observed too:
- The more trend towards urban - the Total rides, Total fares, and total drivers, all increased. This may be due to higher population for more urban areas as compared to rural
- Average fare per ride decreased when trending in the more urban direction - likely due to distances that need to be traveled are shorter in urban centers.

Consider also the following and you can see how lopsided the rides and percentage of rides/drivers by city are in rural areas as compared to more urban areas:

## Summary
The following are some of the areas where this data can be utilized:
- There is an opportunity for increased fares in urban areas since this where most of the rides are happening.
- There is an opportunity to offer driver incentives for rural areas since this is where the least rides are being seen.
- There is a difference in avg fare per driver. This means they may pull drivers out to the suburbs/rural areas as well in order to fill the rides void.
